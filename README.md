# Fight or flight
## Shoot'em up
A little shoot'em up game I made in Dart with my dad for School in the year 2019-2020.
I didn't make it easy for other people to play, so here's a little explanation of the game:

When you first open the game theres the main menu with a level select. Each level can have up to 3 stars, depending on how many of the enemies you've defeated. The enemies that appear from the sides have simple flight patters, like sin(), straight line, zig zag, etc. The enemies have different attack patterns: straight, triple shot, double, etc. There's a chance they drop one of the following power ups: pow (explosion), shield, higher shooting speed, etc. Loosing all the hp is a defeat, which opens up a little menu to retry or leave.

The map was made using tiled and imported in base64 to the game, so there were some weird shenanigans to convert that into something we could use. The art and animations are also made by me.
